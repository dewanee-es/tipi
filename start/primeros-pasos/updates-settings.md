# Improve the settings of the updates

You can improve the configuration of the updates as follows.

Click on the grey Ubuntu logo (Dash home). Query: `software`. 
Click on Software & Updates.

Tab Updates:
**When there are security updates:** change it into: `Display immediately`

Reason: it's always better when updates don't get installed automatically. Even when they're security updates. Because there's always the risk that an update might cause a problem (regression).

If you always install updates consciously, then you'll know immediately when a regression hits your system. So you can act rightaway to fix that problem.

**Notify me of a new Ubuntu version:** change that into: `Never`

Reason: if you want to upgrade to a newer Ubuntu, it's always best to do that by means of a clean installation. Upgrading an older version "in place", has a bigger risk of failure. Plus you unavoidably retain some "pollution" from the previous version.
