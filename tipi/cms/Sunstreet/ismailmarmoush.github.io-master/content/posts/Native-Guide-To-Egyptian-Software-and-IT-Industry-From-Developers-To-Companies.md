The following article is more focused on the core elements of the industry which are Individuals and Organizations or Companies.

#### So, Who should be reading this?
CEOs, investors and of course software developers, who are looking for a closer and personal point of view from an Egyptian Software Developer.

>**Disclaimer:** English is my second language feel free to point out any errors or typos.

### Individuals
*"Mostly Software Developers"*

#### Some Demographics
In Egypt there are  42 universities (19 private) or more. With more than 500,000 students out of 6,846,000 in the whole education system. I couldn't find exact average of IT graduates but I guess it's not less than 5,000 a year.

Egypt unemployment rate is 13.4 percent. The rate remained unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2013 at 13.4 percent of a labor force of 27.3 million people, according to state-run statistics body CAPMAS.

Most software companies are located in the Greater Cairo (Cairo + Giza); this might relate somehow to the distribution of the population, but it actually does relate more to urbanization, governmental centralization in cairo, and modernity e.g communications infrastructure. But also there is a rising number of developers comunities in the south  [S'idi Geeks](http://ar.s3geeks.com/) is one of them; The word Saʿīdi is hard to spell for a foreigner but it's related to [Upper Egypt residents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Egypt).


#### Distribution
Unfortunately there are no statistical records (Or I didn't do a good research), but most of graduates are working in:

* IT department in factories,
* [Software Houses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_house) 
* Non software Houses specially Telecommunication companies
* The rest are either in Call centers or have joined other fields

#### Social Status

**For male devs**
Most graduates (not in IT only) would prefer to travel abroad but that is not easy for a country like ours (2.5 million already living living abroad) and so many people want to join them.

So instead most of them tend to gain as much experience as they can get in order to increase their chances of getting a dream job and salary in a Gulf or European country. 

The irony is that again most of them who did make it through in the field and gained experience are the ones who settle and get married which makes the work abroad or immigration a bit risky and hard decision to be made, since leaving their wives at home to save more money in the journey is really hard on them and almost impossible and moving the whole family is also another harder decision economically. 

For single male devs, most of them tend to either completely immigrate, or go back in 3-5 years after saving some money and assets.

**For female devs**

If the situation was reversed, the wife is the one who is traveling, probably her husband will not agree unless he can find a job too.

As for the singles; the cases of female travelers is really low due to ethnic/cultural/religious views. The concept of a girl alone in a foreign country is very odd to Egyptians. Not to mention that most girls do not want to go either, since most of girls know their chances of finding a partner will be less due to religious and ethnic differences between them and the men they'll meet. Also family consent is much harder in such situation.


**Financially** those who made it in Egypt and gained higher levels of experience in the field are actually wanted, not because they're rare but because the industry and software development culture is growing here in a fast pace (details in the companies section), number of vacancies is higher every year, startups and corporates are competing with each other to find candidates. This affects the turn over rates in most companies both national and multinational and brings much higher competence and of course salaries and packages options than any other field in Egypt to the table. 

#### Setbacks and Barriers
*Time management and bureaucracy*

One of the biggest barriers that faces any software developer in Egypt is **time management** since most of the time is wasted in transportation (2-3 hours daily) Greater Cairo is really crowded.

Another reason is socialization; we unfortunately waste much time talking over the phone, chatting, commenting over Facebook, mostly after working hours or in the breaks, but that is still a time wasted.

Most companies enforce 8.30 to 9.00 hours work with 30 to 60 min break, consider this plus a 6.5 average hours of sleep plus plus 2 or 3 hours transportation, sometimes you can't even get more sleep if you wanted to study or learn more.

With that in mind and the fact that Freelancing and Working from home hasn't yet got much attention or trust in Egypt, the time management becomes harder and harder. It's really tough if you wanted to spend some quality time with friends, family, or even yourself. Not to mention if you wanted to pursue higher post graduate education or certificates. 

The traffic problem is much complicated to be solved in the next 5-10 years two of the solutions available were Freelancing and working from home but the one main barrier against them is the low level of communication amongst Egyptians themselves. 

In unfortunate way most of us are sometimes naive when it comes to online communications, we were raised on using Emoticons (currently Emojis).

Sometimes communicating with other fellow colleagues is falsely taken or considered unfriendly if the talk lacks Emoticons, couple of jokes in between, or sweet words. 

Sometimes it's worse when the communication is done through English (thankfully German and dutch languages aren't that popular here, either we would have had lots of trouble) which isn't our mother tongue, and things might get complicated. That's why we prefer (or actually management prefers) communicating in person and that's a deal breaker for  working from home or freelancing.

Luckily this is not the case when communicating with non-Egyptians since we do consider the cultural differences which make us a bit isolated from any awkwardness or sensitivity and more focused on the information being exchanged, which makes our communication more professional with them.

**Bureaucracy**

Unfortunately we tend to create bureaucracy, even if it didn't exist. Even in multinational companies mid level management (mostly Egyptians) always tend to put barriers between employees and CEOs, sometimes it's considered act of misbehavior to reach out to higher levels without going through the hierarch, you could find the **[Rates of our Power distance](http://geert-hofstede.com/egypt.html)** pretty high unfortunately.

But meanwhile the rising number of medium sized multinational companies is a good sign of cultural exchange ahead of us.

**Bureaucracy and Dehumanization** in many Egyptian companies, corporates and organizations usually do not solicit feedback or encourage employees to give their opinion, which keeps creative individuals from adding a value to their working place. My advice is to always watch out for this and try to get closer.

#### Skills, Creativity and Integrity
By the increasing number of Off-Shoring and Outsourcing companies, the number of software projects built in Egypt is getting higher which has created a higher demand for skilled workers to compete with international companies.

Developers (SW Analysts, SW Architects, Programmers and Designers) are uptodate with the latest techniques and trends, don't be surprised when you hear ideas like let's design the software architecture in that xyz way or that API or library is much better than our current one. So prepare for more cooperative decision making and make the best of it.

Most of us are initially **skilled** programmers (Code writers). But Analysts, Software Designers, Business Intelligence and Security specialists are harder to find due to the fact that most of them accepted another offer outside or converted to project managers or technical consultants.

Jobs like Chief Scientist, Analysts are really rare to find, so it's not in many devs plan to achieve it, and not many companies offer it.

But with more years to come and due to demand; more experienced individuals are being recruited or built.

As for **creativity**, unfortunately it's not obvious and the rates are low, that is because **Creativity often requires leisure** -- Aristotle, Ethics-- and that's not an option for a lot of us.

In Egyptian software culture **sincerity, honesty, and principles** are common between most of us, the incidents of fraud, or deception are of low levels.

The reasons behind this do vary from religious views and moralities, unemployment, tendency to avoid troubles, and being in highly paid field which makes most of developers refrain from any bad acts.

Last but not least, most of Egyptians even in other fields tend to rethink and analyze what they're asked to do and the benefits of it.

Sometimes this creates a harder to manage individuals but still creates some confidence that you're not thinking alone. In some different countries and cultures many developers are a bit submissive to their leaders' orders which works sometimes but at the expense of higher quality and right decision making.

#### Psychology and Sociology
Most of Egyptian Developers are like all developers around the world we're geeks, nerds, and mostly socially introverted. To learn more about us read this book [Antipatterns: Managing Software Organizations and People](http://www.amazon.com/Antipatterns-Managing-Software-Organizations-Engineering/dp/1439861862); beaware that this book doesn't describe the majority of devs who are kind and nice persons, but it's a good read anyway.

### Companies, Corporates and Organizations

Before going through Companies and organizations there are important factors we need to talk about.

#### Conway's Law

Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

-- Melvyn Conway, 1967

#### The Up-to-date Factor
This may sound naive to business men, but in most of the companies that I worked or been interviewed in, I found this up-to-date factor always affecting the work environment.

> Companies which use latest technologies, trends, and techniques in their projects are often having the best environment, culture, and team harmony.

This in fact reflects important elements in the running business of these companies. First most of Software developers get bored easily and are always looking for new things; that is due to the fact that our field is actually boring and frustrating. Writing many lines of code isn't that much fun trust me. 

So when those developer are faced with the management decisions regarding the technologies to be used in a forthcoming software project this indicates the company decisions aren't made in the house, or might have been made by a business/technical consultant somewhere half across the world, who has made his decision based on risk management and experience, not quality or modernity.

So when a company decision comes from the house, the decisions begin to take creative nature, developers are more happy teams are in more harmony since they want to make it and they want to prove they're right. They do work more and for free since they love what they're doing. Which in turn makes management happy of the hard working devs, and starts making their lives more fun and easier.

But in companies were old boring technologies are being used, developers tend to become more of "employees" rather than developers, they tend to do what they're told, not much care for the software at hand or building components from scratch. That is because the software is driven by delivery dates not by objectives. 

#### The Gap between Business and Software
The gap between business and software houses is huge in Egypt and many other countries, developers already suffer from the up-to-date factor, and the abused Agile software engineering methodology.

Business sector rely on companies selling them Agile software development life cycle, and they both think the following quote means agility:

> *"Oh, you can change your requirement anytime you want, and we will still deliver in the same time you wanted with the earlier requirement"* 

Sorry you're kidding yourselves. The quote describes account executives who don't consult with neither System Analysts nor System Designers (If the company did have one, usually a Team leader does both) or even developers if they didn't have experienced people.

Don't lie to business men, you might win a deal today but those men will break your neck tomorrow for delivering poorly written software solutions. 

**You're ruining our culture, and ruining the quality of code Egypt produces and making us more into India** that's why most of startups and corporates do lay offs and end in bankruptcy.

The Gap factor can be diminished easily when the IT department at the company/factory/organization stops interfering or consulting the stakeholders with the right tools to build their solution.

The Gap factor will be reduced when technical consultancy companies stop relying on enterprise solutions as (safer ones) instead of great open source ones, or relying on old "stable" (that's what they think) technologies written 5 years ago.

Please understand that today's API, Libraries, techniques, software architecture, and trends are much well structured, pluggable, customizable and usable than the old ones. So make use of it.

#### Management

One of the biggest problems in Egypt is management, we do have much resources, we have the land, and the skilled workers, Egypt doesn't suffer regularly from storms, tornadoes, typhoons, earthquakes or any of that, but we do suffer Management, Political stability, Freedom, bureaucracy as mentioned earlier, and many third world challenges.

The previous combination makes higher unemployment, with high competition and lower salaries than other countries. Despite how unprosperous that is it has opened a new door for a better foreign management through off-shoring and outsourcing, that international business is more beneficial and agile than the local one.

Slowly Egyptians are learning management and creating business opportunities locally, but there's a progress.

#### Transparency
Most companies in Egypt lack transparency, unfortunately some of them think that if they were open about their profits, their employees will ask for a raise. 

Another reason is that most of companies in Egypt aren't public in stock market, so there is no obligation besides it's better for them to avoid large taxes.

#### Vision
We were just talking about transparency, and again not many companies have such transparent vision or an open plan. The vision you see in the About section of a company's website is sometimes copy pasted or not applied.

But of course, there are good ones and they do have real vision and path. These companies are the ones where you should invest in or work for.

It's very important to ask about this in your interview and listen carefully then ask more in the details mentioned; so as to see how well the CEO, HR manager plans for the future of this company.

I believe every company should have a [BHAG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Built_to_Last:_Successful_Habits_of_Visionary_Companies) of its own.

#### Culture

This [article:Don't fuck up the culture](https://medium.com/@bchesky/dont-fuck-up-the-culture-597cde9ee9d4) sums it all up.


### A Quick Comparison

#### Local/Public sector Software Companies
**Work environment** is Poor.
**Salary** is much lower than other companies for employees but higher for management (tips, bribes)
**Management** is at its highest levels of bureaucracy.
**Creativity** mass murderers

#### Medium Software Houses 
**Work environment** more fun and in harmony
**Salary** higher than public sector of course, lower or equal to off shoring.
**Management** usually focus on delivery but still making good impression with high quality since they want to keep their business alive, and since they are also competing with other multinational companies.
**Creativity** is a bit high since many team leaders act as System Analysts or Architects.

#### Medium Off-shoring Companies
**Work Environment** a bit richer that the most of the others with much more facilities and fancy hardware. Although there isn't much fun and teams look dull somehow.
**Management** mostly directors are non egyptians or egyptians living abroad which creates some gap between them and mid level management (human resources, accounting etc..) and software developers.
**Creativity** not much creativity is being asked for since most projects are either remade from legacy systems, and technologies to be used are already decided on.

#### Companies with R&D division
To begin with these are really hard to find companies in Egypt, we lack both expertise and fund to host such great companies. So I can't give much information about it.

#### Small rich companies (their own software)
**Work Environment** Awesome, but edgy, new comers are not mostly welcome, fun and personal.
**Salary** is at it's highest rate
**Management** very close and friendly you might find the CEO coding beside you or is your team leader
**Creativity** at its highest levels too, since they own the software

#### Corporates
Here comes the boredom, the statistics, the working hours rates the yearly corporate income and of course the sweet lay offs

**Work environment** mostly hostile, Employees like developers, and bad mouthing.
**Salary** might not be high but other benifits appear in the package like medical insurance, transportation, gym, etc

#### Organizations
We don't have software (non) profit organizations, I never heard of an organization in Egypt added a standard value to the software community, may be I don't know, but sure it's not popular.

Second part of this article will be about interviews I had, ridiculous and brilliant questions I've been asked, Engineers, HR and CEOs I've met, those who I resented or been inspired by.
